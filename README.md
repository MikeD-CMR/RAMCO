# RAMCO-API-PHP-Class
An object oriented approach to implementing the RAMCO API written in PHP. This was created to hopefully make it easier to connect to multiple RAMCO Instances at once for the purposes of data sharing or synchronization.

See example-uses.php for 5 Scenarios of using the RAMCO API as an object.

Full API Documentation can be found here:
https://api.ramcoams.com/api/v2/ramco_api_v2_doc.pdf

This class was inspired by Luis Pena of the Florida Association of REALTORS who created the first RAMCO API Class for version 1 of the api.
